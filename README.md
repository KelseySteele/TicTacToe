# TicTacToe

I am a begining web developer. I am teaching myself how to code. Here is a practice tic tac toe game. 

At first, I just got the basic tic tac toe game. I used buttons to create the tic tac toe board. 
I then, added changes to this basic game by using game objects to make the code more readable and to practice with using objects. 
I created a counter for the number of O and X wins. I learned that a return statement in JavaScript can only return one variable.

I wanted to return, two variables (X & O) and though I could use either arrays or objects. I decided that objects made the code 
more readable and opted for that option. At this point, each game alternates between starting with an "X" and starting with an "O".
